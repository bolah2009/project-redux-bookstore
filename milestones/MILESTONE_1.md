# Milestone 1

## Introduction
You need to build the foundation of your project, and because this project does not differ much from the React Calculator you built before, we'll the use same pre-defined components. You are going to create the project with `react-create-app` package and install `redux` and `react-redux` to connect these two pieces together.

## Requirements

1. You should use npm to initialize a new Node.js project
    - Provide a description
    - Provide server.js as the starting file
    - Check the resulting package.json file
    - Documentation: [https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init)
2. You should use npm to install the following packages:
    - `react`, `react-dom`, `react-redux`, `redux`
    - Documentation: [http://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html](http://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html)
3. You should add `react-scripts` as a development dependency
    - Install it and save it as a development dependency
    - Configure start, build, and test scripts in package.json
    - Documentation: [https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/next/packages/react-scripts](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/next/packages/react-scripts)
4. You should initialize the project directory structure
    - Create `/src` directory
    - Add `index.js` to /src directory and import React libraries there. Use ReactDOM to render the basic markup: [https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html)
    - Create `/public` directory
    - Add `index.html` file with basic HTML template. Make sure your html includes a root div with a unique ID so you can render React into it.
