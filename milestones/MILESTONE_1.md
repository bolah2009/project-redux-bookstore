# Milestone 1

## Introduction
You need to build foundation of your project and because that project does not differ much from [React Calculator](https://github.com/microverseinc/project-react-calculator-solution)
, we'll use same pre-defined components. You are going to create project with `react-create-app` package and install `redux` and
`react-redux` to connect these two pieces together.

## Requirements

1. You should use npm to initialize a new Node.js project
   - Provide a description
   - Provide server.js as the starting file
   - Check the resulting package.json file
   - Documentation: [https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init)
2. You should use npm to install following packages:
   - `react`, `react-dom`, `react-redux`, `redux`
   - Documentation: [http://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html](http://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html)
3. You should add `react-scripts` as a development dependency
   - Install it and save it as a development dependency
   - Configure start, build, and test scripts in package.json
   - Documentation: [https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/next/packages/react-scripts](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/next/packages/react-scripts)
4. You should initialize the project directory structure
   - Create `/src` directory
   - Add `index.js` to /src directory and import React libraries there. Use ReactDOM to render basic markup: [https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html)
   - Create `/public` directory
   - Add `index.html` file with basic HTML template. Make sure your html includes root selector with ID so you can attach React render to it.
