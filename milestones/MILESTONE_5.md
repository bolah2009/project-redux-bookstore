# Milestone 5

## Introduction

So far, you have implemented all the frontend functionality of the bookstore management app using React and Redux. However, the application still looks very ugly. In this milestone, you will follow the provided design specs to build a UI for your app.

## Requirements

1. Review the design file from above and identify all the elements
    - Notice there are features that you haven't implemented yet (e.g. Comments). Feel free to ignore them.
    - You can find the full design specs in [this Zeplin project](https://zpl.io/29Z8Akl). If you don't have access to it, please request it to info@microverse.org
2. Implement the styling of the different components based on the design

That's it! Your application is fully functional and ready to be handed over to the client. Great work :)
